# Generate Plots for the QAO Skript

This repo contains the python scripts to generate images to the quantum acoustics script.

Requires python 3.9+, and the numpy, scipy, matplotlib and qutip packages. You can install them all using the requirements.txt 

```
# With pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# With conda
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

Running `main.py` generates all images at once. Might take a while.
